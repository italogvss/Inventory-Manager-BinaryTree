# Inventory Manager with Binary File Storage and Binary Tree Indexing
This repository showcases a college project aimed at creating an efficient product manager using C programming. The project's core features include storing product information in a binary file and maintaining product indices through a binary tree structure. The system populates its product database by parsing data from a text file.
# Overview
The primary objective of this project was to design and implement a product management system using C that allows for seamless insertion, retrieval, and indexing of products. The project utilizes a combination of binary file storage and a binary search tree for efficient data management.
